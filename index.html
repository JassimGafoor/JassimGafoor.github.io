				<h3>Hi, I'm Jassim.</h3>
				<p>
					I am a fourth year Integrated Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia. I focus on Electrical and Computer Engineering and am actively looking for a related co-op oppurtunity. Please reach out to me at four@alumni.ubc.ca </br>

					I grew up in Qatar, where I did my A-Levels at Doha College. I learned about robotics, programming, graphic design and physics. I chose engineering as my career because I love a challenge and learn something new everyday. </br>

					In my spare time I ride bikes, swim and cook. I also play badminton, football and video-games.
